Telescope is a simple window/task switcher for linux that, when activated, pops up live displays of all windows and lets you switch to or close any of them.

The original project was located at https://bitbucket.org/IlyaSkriblovsky/telescope but hasn't been updated in 9 months and used mercurial. I'm making changes to make it work better with archlinux and dwm, but nearly all the code is from llyaSkriblovsky on bitbucket.
